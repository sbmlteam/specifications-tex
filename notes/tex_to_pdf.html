<h1>Making PDFs from LaTeX files</h1>


<h3>Problem</h3>
So you've written the killer paper for a conference (in LaTeX, of course, what
else is there? :), generated the PostScript file, and want to share your
findings with the rest of the world.  Oh wait, what's this?  The conference
wants a PDF file submission.  Grumble.

<p>
SIDENOTE: you may be asking yourself "why, oh why, can't they be like
normal people and require a PS file?"  I found myself asking that very
question.  Luckily I ran across <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/publ-tips.html">this</a> link which
outlines the benefits of PDFs over PS files for research publication.  I'm
sold.

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>
The first thing you might try to do is to use "epstopdf" or Acrobat Distiller
on your PostScript file.  You'll notice right away that the result is not very
good.  Solution: use "pdflatex".

<p>
Like the name suggests, "pdflatex" generates a PDF directly from a LaTeX file.
"pdflatex" (and its parent, "pdftex") are relatively new programs (still in
beta).  This means that there are still some rough corners here and there.
Nonetheless, the results are very good, and the effort is well worth it.

<p>
Benefits of using "pdflatex" instead of doing the PS->PDF conversion:
<ul>
<li>the pdflatex file will be word searchable (acrobat "Find" command works)
<li>allows fully-working URL hyperlinks
<li>can be made into funky web presentations (see one of the links at end of
    page); a poor man's PowerPoint substitute?
<li>scalable fonts are used, instead of the default LaTeX bitmapped ones (the
latter look very ugly when scaled and the PDF takes very long to render on
screen with them) 
</ul>


<h3>Basic procedure</h3>

<ul>

<li>Do not use epsfig, or any other old image inclusion package; use
"graphics" or "graphicx".  This package is the newest and most flexible, and
is meant to supersede the others.  This means that you not only have to add
"\usepackage{graphicx}" in the preamble, but you also need to replace any
"\epsfig" or other image inclusion commands with "\includegraphics".  The
syntax for the parameters is very similar.  For more info on this step go <a
href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/miaou/latex/latex.html#FAQ1">here</a>, or check
the epslatex file (see Hints section below).

<li>If you want to be able to build PS and PDF files from the same source,
leave off the file extensions from the image filenames in the
"\includegraphics" calls (eg:
"\includegraphics[width=0.28\textwidth]{figs/solution}").  Next, you need to
provide the images in two flavours: one for when building a PS file, and one
for the PDF file.  For the PS build, it's usually best to have the images
available in .eps format.  For the PDF you can use .pdf, .jpg, .png, and maybe
some others.  Note that you cannot use .eps files (directly) in the PDF build;
PDF is a subset of PS.

<li>If an image that you need to include in the PDF is only available in .ps
or .eps format, you'll need to convert it first to a PDF.  Try this:
<pre>
cat &lt<zzz>file.eps> | tr \\015 \\012 | epstopdf --filter > &lt<zzz>file.pdf>
</pre>

<li>If this doesn't give good results, convert the image to a .jpg or .png,
and use that in the PDF.

<li>Now the final step: use "pdflatex" to build a PDF file, or "latex" to build a .dvi file (and the PS file with 'dvips').

</ul>



<h3>Useful hints</h3>
<ul>
<li>some useful stuff to stick into your Makefiles:
<pre>
.SUFFIXES: .eps .pdf .tif .gif .jpg .pbm .pgm .ppm .dvi .fig .ps .tex $(SUFFIXES
)

.tif.eps:
        tifftopnm $< | pnmtops -noturn > $@

.gif.eps:
        giftopnm $< | pnmtops -noturn > $@

.jpg.eps:
        djpeg $< | pnmtops -noturn > $@

.pbm.eps:
        pnmtops -noturn $< > $@

.pgm.eps:
        pnmtops -noturn $< > $@

.ppm.eps:
        pnmtops -noturn $< > $@

.dvi.ps:
        dvips $<

.dvi.eps:
        dvips -E $< -o $@

.tex.dvi:
        tex $<

.fig.eps:
        fig2dev -L eps -c -p dummy_arg -z Letter $< $@

.eps.pdf:
        cat $< | tr \\015 \\012 | epstopdf --filter > $@

</pre>

<li>For a reference on including images and graphics in your LaTeX files, check
out the two big documents (epslatex.ps and grfguide.ps) in
/usr/share/texmf/doc/latex/graphics.  Currently these files only exist on
'hades', as that's the only place where I've installed the "tetex-doc" package
(it is rather large).

<li>Check out the other files in /usr/share/texmf/doc/latex*.  Some really
useful info there; I wish I knew about it sooner.  Excellent reference source
for doing all kinds of stuff with LaTeX.

</ul>
