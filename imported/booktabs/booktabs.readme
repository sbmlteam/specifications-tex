This is booktabs.readme

Package provides publication quality tables for LaTeX
(can be used in 2.09 with a minor change to booktabs.sty
documented therein).

For documentation (including justification for recommending
this package) LaTeX2e users can just print the output of

latex booktabs.dtx

2.09 users will have to read this file as best they can.
