README for breakurl, version 1.10 (2005/09/23)


INTRODUCTION
============

The breakurl is an extension to hyperref package that allows line-breakable
\url-like links when compiling via latex + dvips + ps2pdf.


DESCRIPTION
===========

This package provides a command much like hyperref's \url that typesets a URL
using a typewriter-like font.  However, if the dvips driver is being used, the
original \url doesn't allow line breaks in the middle of the created link: the
link comes in one atomic piece.  This package allows such line breaks in the
generated links.

Note that this package is intended only for those using the dvips driver.
Users of the pdflatex driver already have this feature.


INSTALLATION
============

a) Download the package files from CTAN or the TUG server.

b) Generate the `breakurl.sty' file:

     latex breakurl.ins

c) Install the file `breakurl.sty' in your TDS tree:

     mkdir .../texmf/tex/latex/breakurl
     cp breakurl.sty .../texmf/tex/latex/breakurl/

   where `...' is the prefix of your TDS tree.

d) Update the databases if necessary, eg. for teTeX:

     mktexlsr .../texmf

   or for MiKTeX: Click Start menu > Programs > MiKTeX > MiKTeX Options, then
   click in the `Refresh Now' button.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

Please see the breakurl.pdf for a more comprehensive description of the
package, its options, issues, etc.  Or generate a breakurl.dvi version of it
via the following command:

     latex breakurl.dtx
