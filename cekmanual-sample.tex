\section{Introduction}

The goal of the ERATO \emph{Systems Biology Workbench} (SBW) project is to
create an open-source, integrated software environment for systems biology
that enables sharing of models and resources between simulation and
analysis tools.

\section{Testing code examples}


The goal of the ERATO \emph{Systems Biology Workbench} (SBW) project is to
create an open-source, integrated software environment for systems biology
that enables sharing of models and resources between simulation and
analysis tools.
